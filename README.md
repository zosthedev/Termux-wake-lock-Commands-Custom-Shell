Simple custom bash script that  works for termux.apk

and any proot-distro.

You can use this just shout me out for the idea of creating

it.

a simple program to show termux-wake-lock enabled or

disabled.

If you forget to use command 

git clone it to any proot-distro {alias} i.e parrot.

you can just use bash script to acquire wake lock or 

disable wake lock.

Just tested this in proot-distro using parrot and cloned 

the repo and executed the commands and I enabled and disabled wake lock.

Happy Coding, zosthedev
